# 3D Ring Game

This is a 3D C++ game made for a game development course in our 4th year of school.
The focus of the game was to move around a set field with floating rings and to put your controlled object into the correct ring at each level. 
Each level had a math problem and each ring on the level had a number with only 1 ring containing the correct answer.

This game may not look pretty but it was done to show off collision detection through the use of boundaries and object detection, as well as showing off a fluid level progression with score and a start/end screen
